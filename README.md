## Summary

Here's a summary of the network analysis methods utilised:
1. Degree Centrality 
2. Betweeness Centrality
3. Key Player Analysis
4. Louvain Community Detection & Monte Carlo Simulations

How to replicate the analysis?
1. Download both excel spreadsheets
2. Copy the downloaded spreadsheets to your desktop
3. Run the source code in R (remember to set the correct working directory!)

## Important

InfluenceR package runs into errors with igraph so remember to detach it once the key-player analysis has been conducted.
